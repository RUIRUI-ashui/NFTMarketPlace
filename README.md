## Final Project for course ELEN 6883 Blockchain 
### NFT Marketplace Smart Contract Development
This project presents the design and implementation of a secure and efficient NFT marketplace smart contract that enables the creation, buying, selling, and trading of unique digital assets in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The project involves the development of an ERC-721 compliant smart contract, and the implementation of additional features to ensure security and usability. The marketplace smart contract covers the NFT lifecycle from minting to trading, querying, and providing a comprehensive solution for users to interact with NFTs in a secure and efficient manner.

The testing of the NFT Collection and NFT Marketplace smart contracts using the Truffle framework and Mocha testing framework with the Chai assertion library has been successful, with all tests passing. These results demonstrate that the smart contract functions as intended, allowing users to list, buy, sell, and trade NFTs securely and efficiently.

Overall, this project provides a valuable contribution to the NFT ecosystem, providing a secure and efficient NFT marketplace that can be used by artists, musicians, and other creators to monetize their work and engage with their fans. The availability of the project code on Github makes it easy for other developers to use and build on the work done in this project to create even more sophisticated NFT marketplaces and applicationsã€‚
