# NFTMarketPlace
## Final Project for course ELEN 6883 Blockchain 
This project presents the design and implementation of a secure and efficient NFT marketplace smart contract that enables the creation, buying, selling, and trading of unique digital assets in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The project involves the development of an ERC-721 compliant smart contract, and the implementation of additional features to ensure security and usability. The marketplace smart contract covers the NFT lifecycle from minting to trading, querying, and providing a comprehensive solution for users to interact with NFTs in a secure and efficient manner.
